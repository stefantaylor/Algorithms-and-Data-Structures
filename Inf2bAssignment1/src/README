Instructions to use scratch space memory:

1) Copy the current version of BigInt.java to another file.
2) Copy the file versions/BigInt.scratch to imult/BigInt.java
3) Copy the file versions/MemoryFarm.java to imult/MemoryFarm.java
4) Use the static method MemoryFarm.init() to initialize the 
   needed memory in an appropriate place, i.e., a main() method or
   at the beginning of BigIntMul.getRunTimes(). 
5) Use the static method MemoryFarm.dealloc() to reset the 
   scratch space in an appropriate place, i.e., in getRunTimes() 
   after each timed execution of koMul() or koMulOpt().
6) Recompile everything and run the code with Xmx1024m switch. You will see points of inconsistencies for the runtimes. These are the Java GC doing its thing.
